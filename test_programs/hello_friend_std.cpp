//my first c++ program, how neat!
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{

    //std::cout << "Hello friend.";//standard character output device
    cout << "\nHello friend.\n";//standard character output device

    std::cout << "printing some more stuff...";//looks like this works too

}
